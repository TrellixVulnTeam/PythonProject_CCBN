Low costs of studying and living - Although Poland is going through a process of rapid economic development, the cost of living is still significantly lower than in most of the EU countries. A total amount of 200-400 Euros is enough to cover the basic cost of accommodation, food and transport. The cost of entertainment and participation in cultural events are also much lower than EU average. The basic cost of studies is also very competitive. The minimum rate is 2000 Euro a year, which is a few times lower than the EU average. For rapid economic development Since 20 years Polish economy has significantly been growing. According to Central Statistical Office’s data, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2008 was in real terms 4.8 per cent higher than in 2007. In 2007 GDP recorded 6.7 per cent growth. The rate of the value added growth for whole economy in 2008 was 4.9 per cent (6.6% in 2007). According to the latest European Commission’s forecast, in 2010 the GDP growth may dip to 2.0 per cent. Taking into account, however, international crisis and -1.8 per cent GDP growth forecast for the EU-25, Poland’s result is a symptom of Polish strong economy. The unemployment level decreases very quickly, falling from almost 20% in 2004 to 9,5 % in 2009.
